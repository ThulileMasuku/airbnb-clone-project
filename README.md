## üß© UI/UX Design Planning

### üéØ Design Goals

The goal of the UI/UX design is to provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface that enhances the user experience across devices. The interface should help users easily browse listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings with minimal friction. A user-first approach guides all design decisions to ensure accessibility, clarity, and speed.

Key design objectives:
- Ensure a mobile-first responsive layout
- Minimize cognitive load and simplify navigation
- Provide immediate visual feedback for user interactions
- Build trust through clean visuals, consistent UI components, and smooth flows

### üîë Key Features to Implement

- Search bar with filters (location, price, dates, guests)
- Interactive map and card-based property listing
- Detailed listing pages with images, descriptions, and amenities
- Booking system with date picker and price summary
- Simple and secure checkout process
- Intuitive navigation and error handling
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

### üìÑ Page Descriptions

| Page                     | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a searchable and filterable list of property cards. Each card shows a preview image, title, rating, price, and location.                |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Provides an in-depth look at a single property. Includes image gallery, amenities, host information, location map, and availability calendar.    |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | A streamlined booking page showing reservation details, input for guest information, and payment options. Ends with a confirmation screen.        |

### ü§ù Importance of User-Friendly Design

In a booking system, a user-friendly interface is crucial to build trust, reduce drop-off rates, and ensure a smooth user journey. A clear, predictable layout helps users navigate without confusion, while accessible design makes the platform usable for everyone, including those with disabilities. Minimizing friction during critical flows like searching, booking, and payment increases conversion rates and provides a positive user experience that encourages repeat visits.
